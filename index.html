              <p>Eric: Welcome listeners to Swords and Spears. I’m Eric, and we have a very special guest today. He’s an expert in the Middle Ages, and he’ll be talking today about Medieval music. His name is Adam!</p>
              <p>Adam: Thank you for having me on your podcast.</p>
              <p>Eric: All Right. So, Adam, what kind of instruments did they use during the Medieval Period?</p>
              <p>Adam: So during the Medieval Period, there was a very wide variety of differently used instruments, one of them being the organetto, which was a small, portable set of playable organs. They were pumped and played by the same person. Next, we have the psaltery, which was a wooden slab with strings running vertically. These strings were usually plucked by hand.</p>
              <p>Eric: Like with a guitar?</p>
              <p>Adam: Uh, yeah, pretty much. Only, it didn’t have a neck, just a wooden slab with strings attached. Next, we have the dulcimer, which was very reminiscent to the psaltery, only it is laid down usually in your lap and played with two plucking sticks.</p>
              <p>Eric: What exactly is a plucking stick?</p>
              <p>Adam: Pretty much just a wooden, carved out—it looked like a fang kind of. I mean, all you would do is just pluck, pluck the strings with it.</p>
              <p>Eric: Like a saw?</p>
              <p>Adam: Yeah, pretty much. Next we have the rebec, which was pretty much just a baby violin, or a viol, as it was called at the time. It only had three strings, which were played with a small bow.</p>
              <p>Eric: Did they also use stuff like lutes and harps?</p>
              <p>Adam: Yeah, they did. They were widely used actually, and they were very—they didn’t change much as they are today as they were back then.</p>
              <p>Eric: All right, so what kind of music did they play during the Medieval Period? What genres were there?</p>
              <p>Adam: So, a very popular genre was called secular. What secular pretty much meant was non-religious. And that consisted of ballads such as heroic tales, romance tales, Arabian and Persian love songs, lyric poetry and song, things like that. And of course, dancing influenced music as well. Things such as line dancing and circle dancing were very popular at the time. And off course, religion was very—a very influential factor of music at the time. Of course, we have Christianity and Islam rising, and Christian music was—usually consisted of lyrical singing, as instruments were banned from Church music.</p>
              <p>Eric: So just singing.</p>
              <p>Adam: Yeah.</p>
              <p>Eric: So how exactly was music notated?</p>
              <p>Adam: So music—oh, here, I have a visual representation of a—</p>
              <p>Eric: Thank you.</p>
              <p>Adam: Yeah, there you go. So, as they are today, music was notated on, of course, paper, only back then, they were called neumes, and if you look at the paper, or the sheet, or the neume, I should say, you can really tell the differences.</p>
              <p>Eric: So the things I notice right away is that there aren’t really any stems. There’s not really any kind of rhythm. They’re all like—</p>
              <p>Adam: It’s all over the place, isn’t it?</p>
              <p>Eric: Yeah, and there are only four lines instead of five.</p>
              <p>Adam: So, yeah, again they were notated on a sheet called a neume.</p>
              <p>Eric: So, how was music performed then?</p>
              <p>Adam: So, music was performed, during the 15th century, usually in small groups, and these groups consisted of, usually three to five people in a small room playing either a harp, lute, or recorder, or whatever instrument was being played, in small outside bands, usually playing in front of a, you know, in towns and stuff like that. And of course you had music being played at weddings and things like that. Dance. You also had backup dancers accompanying bands and things like that. Next question?</p>
              <p>Eric: All right. So, how did Medieval style music come to be?</p>
              <p>Adam: Well, it’s very uncertain how it came to be. A lot of people say that it was very—well, it derived from Roman music in the 5th century. So, early medieval music, you can really—</p>
              <p>Eric: So that’s when the Roman Empire fell?</p>
              <p>Adam: Yeah, early 5th century Medieval music, you can really see that, or you can sense that influence of Roman culture in the music. And in the 8th and 10th centuries, Gregorian chanting, which was music organized by Pope Gregory I, was very popular at the time. It was also called plainsong, which because there was literally no music—or no musical instruments in the composition of the music. Parallel melodies develop, things like that. In the 11th to 13th centuries, of course we have the Crusades going on during this time, so they heavily influenced music. What they did, they brought back Eastern musical ideas.</p>
              <p>Eric: Like Eastern songs?</p>
              <p>Adam: Yeah. In the 12th century, we had polyphony, which meant independent melodies, and secular songs spread across Europe.</p>
              <p>Eric: So this was going on during the Crusades?</p>
              <p>Adam: Yeah. We also had troubadours, or trouvères, which were professional secular musicians, so composers and things like that. And of course, we had ars nova, which was—came right after ars antiqua, and ars nova just translates to “New Art.” It was a very distinct type of music at the time, and it developed into the Renaissance music.</p>
              <p>Eric: All right. I’m Eric, and that was Adam. Thank you for listening to Swords and Spears! Be sure to tune in next week, where we’ll talk about Medieval weapons and battles.</p>
              <p>Adam: Oh, thank you for having me on.</p>

        <h4>More Medieval Instruments</h4>
        <p>There are many more Medieval instruments that Adam did not have time to talk about in the podcast. Among them is the <strong>gemshorn</strong>, which was a flute made out of the horn of an ox. It was used in early Hebrew ceremonies. The <strong>vielle</strong> was similar to a violin but had a deeper and longer body. In addition, it had three to five strings. The <strong>pipe</strong> and the <strong>tabor</strong> were usually played by the same person, the pipe being played by one hand and the tabor being played by the other. The pipe was similar to a recorder but only had three holes. The tabor was a type of drum. As well as the lute and the harp, the <strong>harpsichord</strong> and the <strong>bagpipe</strong> were other familiar instruments used in Medieval times.</p>
        <h4>Medieval Style</h4>
        <p>Part of the unique Medieval style comes from the performances. Of course, the <em>instruments</em> played a large part in the sound of Medieval pieces. Medieval pieces were played by <em>small groups</em>, as Adam said, and this contributed to the tavern-like feeling of the music. Instuments accompanied voices at unison or octave for decoration. <strong>Polyphony</strong> was in wide use, with each instrument playing a different melody, in contrast to the modern style of <strong>homophony</strong>, a melody over an accompaniment. <em>Parallel fifths</em> and <em>unconventional harmony</em> were other important parts of the Medieval style. Many pieces were in the <em>Dorian</em> mode, as opposed to the common <em>Ionian</em> mode used in pieces today. However, an important thing to keep in mind is that there is a difference between the music of the <strong>Medieval</strong> and <strong>Renaissance</strong> periods, which are often associated.</p>
        <h4>More on the history of Medieval music</h4>
        <p>After the <strong>ars antiqua</strong> period of 13th century France came the <strong>ars nova</strong> period of 14th century France, "New Art." There was a flourishing of polyphonic music during this time, as well as developments in rhythmic notation. It should be noted that the <strong>Italian ars nova</strong> is different than that of the French. The Italian ars nova is another term for <strong>Italian trecento (1300) music</strong>, the period of flourishing for Italian music, which extends from the 1300s to 1420. It was largely brought about by the beginnings of <strong>troubadours</strong>, or people who played secular music for a living. After the ars nova came <strong>ars subtilior</strong>, "Subtle Art." The music of the ars subtilior style was rhythmically and notationally complex and was hard to sing. They had very subtle nuances, in direct contrast to ars nova music. The music of the <strong>Renaissance</strong> came about with the rise of <strong>humanism</strong>, the view of humans as the center of the universe, with the polyphony of ars nova and the subtleness of ars subtilior carrying on into future centuries.</p>
        <h4>Backstage</h4>
        <p>Adam refuses to say the word troubadour (ˈtruːbədʊər) ever again. Or trouvère (tʁuvɛʁ). And definitely not recorded.</p>
        <h4>Fun fact</h4>
        <p>A female troubdaour is called a trobairitz.</p>
        <h4>Nitpick</h4>
        <p>A neume is actually the basic unit of the Medieval musical notation, not the sheet.</p>
